          If you ever find yourself in my childhood home and get your hands on
          my baby album, you’ll find a picture. It’s a picture of me, probably a
          little over one year old, sitting in front of a computer, mouse in
          hand. The year might have been 2001, and it’s my first documented
          usage of a computer.
        </p>
        <p>
          My first memory of using a computer happened years later. Probably
          sometime around 2004. I was four or five years old. My mom, needing to
          focus on more pressing things, sat me down in a chair and put the
          mouse in my hand once again. The computer was an HP Pavilion 512n
          desktop. She gave me the briefest tutorial on how to use Internet
          Explorer. What to click and what not to. That would be the last time
          she taught me how to do something on the computer. The tables were
          turned from then on.
        </p>
        <p>
          And no wonder. Any computer could be my makeshift babysitter; I had
          nothing but time, and I spent countless hours playing flash games,
          watching videos, and learning. I had no problem with it. In fact, I
          looked forward to it. I still remember the excitement from that first
          memory of using a computer. I had seen something that day and I had to
          tell my mother the news.
          <br />
          <br />
          “Mom! Come look!”
          <br />
          <br />
          “What honey?”
          <br />
          <br />
          “Come! I’m the one-millionth visitor!”
        </p>
        <p>
          The vividly animated ad banner at the top of what may have been Yahoo
          or MSN had my four- or five-year-old mind enrapt. It didn’t stand a
          chance. My mother, knowing better, calmly let me down. “Oh, they’re
          just trying to fool you. It’s a scam, honey,” she said. I felt
          disappointed, but as any gambler or psychologist knows, it’s not just
          the highs that get you addicted, but the lows.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a while, life handed me computer time in a piecemeal fashion. The
          HP desktop had given it’s all and gave out. I spent time on the
          computer at the school computer lab, the library, and my mother’s
          friend’s laptop. I would take anything I could get. It wasn’t until I
          was 11 that I got my first laptop. Actually, it wasn’t mine, but I
          sure acted like it was. We were inseparable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast forward to my senior year of high school. Graduation is around
          the corner, but I’m still unsure of what to study. I had already
          resolved to take a gap year. My father was sick with Parkinson’s
          Disease, and I knew my time with him was limited. I had to go back to
          Jamaica. My friend, who was the only member of our high school
          programming club, invited me and another friend to join. We joined
          with the idea that we were going to learn the programming language
          C++. We didn’t. There was not nearly enough time or meetings in the
          year to do so. So, any hope I had of learning how to program was
          dashed.
        </p>
        <p>
          While in Jamaica, I was unsatisfied with having missed the opportunity
          to learn programming. Thus, I would teach myself. After gathering
          online resources and auditing online courses, I found that I rather
          enjoyed programming. It was challenging, but the challenges were
          rewarding to overcome. In hindsight, I’ve realized that there are very
          few interests that overpower my laziness and engage me. I didn’t know
          it then, but I found my drift.
        </p>
        <p>
          For me, programming was a means to an end. Like any artist, the goal
          is not to brush a canvas, but to create something beautiful or
          grotesque. There’s intent, a purpose. My purpose is to build things
          that are easy to look at, easy to use, and easy to put down. Our
          attention is a finite resource. It is fought for daily by those who
          know us better than we know ourselves. It is an unfair battle. Many of
          us are unaware of the war being waged. I am not. I am battle-hardened.
          I took my sword out of the stone and fought back and won.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had a clear path laid in front of me, but social media, YouTube, and
          video games lured me like Sirens in the Odyssey. I had to study myself
          and behavioral psychology to overcome it, and I want to create things
          that help people to do the same. This is my story, and why I’d like to
          study attention. Specifically, how social media and video streaming
          apps affect attention, and how distraction-blocking apps may mitigate
          the effects.
