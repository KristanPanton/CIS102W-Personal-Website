              If you ever find yourself in my childhood home and get your hands
              on my baby album, you’ll find a picture. It’s a picture of me,
              probably a little over one year old, sitting in front of a
              computer, mouse in hand. The year might have been 2001, and it’s
              my first documented usage of a computer.
            </p>
            <p>
              My first memory of using a computer happened years later. Probably
              sometime around 2004. I was four or five years old. My mom,
              needing to focus on more pressing things, sat me down in a chair
              and put the mouse in my hand once again. The computer was an HP
              Pavilion 512n desktop. She gave me the briefest tutorial on how to
              use Internet Explorer. What to click and what not to. That would
              be the last time she taught me how to do something on the
              computer. The tables were turned from then on.
            </p>
            <p>
              And no wonder. Any computer could be my makeshift babysitter; I
              had nothing but time, and I spent countless hours playing flash
              games, watching videos, and learning. I had no problem with it. In
              fact, I looked forward to it. I still remember the excitement from
              that first memory of using a computer. I had seen something that
              day and I had to tell my mother the news.
              <br />
              <br />
              <q>Mom! Come look!</q>
              <br />
              <br />
              <q>What honey?</q>
              <br />
              <br />
              <q>Come! I’m the one-millionth visitor!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
              The vividly animated ad banner at the top of what may have been
              Yahoo or MSN had my four- or five-year-old mind enrapt. It didn’t
              stand a chance. My mother, knowing better, calmly let me down.
              “Oh, they’re just trying to fool you. It’s a scam, honey,” she
              said. I felt disappointed, but as any gambler or psychologist
              knows, it’s not just the highs that get you addicted, but the
              lows.
            </p>
            <p>
              For a while, life handed me computer time in a piecemeal fashion.
              The HP desktop had given it’s all and gave out. I spent time on
              the computer at the school computer lab, the library, and my
              mother’s friend’s laptop. I would take anything I could get. It
              wasn’t until I was 11 that I got my first laptop. Actually, it
              wasn’t mine, but I sure acted like it was. We were inseparable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fast forward to my senior year of high school. Graduation is
              around the corner, but I’m still unsure of what to study. I had
              already resolved to take a gap year. My father was sick with
              Parkinson’s Disease, and I knew my time with him was limited. I
              had to go back to Jamaica. My friend, who was the only member of
              our high school programming club, invited me and another friend to
              join. We joined with the idea that we were going to learn the
              programming language C++. We didn’t. There was not nearly enough
              time or meetings in the year to do so. So, any hope I had of
              learning how to program was dashed.
            </p>
            <p>
              While in Jamaica, I was unsatisfied with having missed the
              opportunity to learn programming. Thus, I would teach myself.
              After gathering online resources and auditing online courses, I
              found that I rather enjoyed programming. It was challenging, but
              the challenges were rewarding to overcome. In hindsight, I’ve
              realized that there are very few interests that overpower my
              laziness and engage me. I didn’t know it then, but I found my
              drift.
            </p>
            <p>
              For me, programming was a means to an end. Like any artist, the
              goal is not to brush a canvas, but to create something beautiful
              or grotesque. There’s intent, a purpose. My purpose is to build
              things that are easy to look at, easy to use, and easy to put
              down. Our attention is a finite resource. It is fought for daily
              by those who know us better than we know ourselves. It is an
              unfair battle. Many of us are unaware of the war being waged. I am
              not. I am battle-hardened. I took my sword out of the stone and
              fought back and won.
            </p>
            <p>
              I had a clear path laid in front of me, but social media, YouTube,
              and video games lured me like Sirens in the Odyssey. I had to
              study myself and behavioral psychology to overcome it, and I want
              to create things that help people to do the same. This is my
              story, and why I’d like to study attention. Specifically, how
              social media and video streaming apps affect attention, and how
              distraction-blocking apps may mitigate the effects.
